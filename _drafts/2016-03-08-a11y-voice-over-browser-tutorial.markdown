The first thing you should care about when considering enhancing the a11y (or a-**ccessibilit**-y) is to improve your caring abilities for those who require it, and given that you're reading this, I'll assume you have an inclusive mind, just like the web was built to be.

For developers using Macs, there's a built-in screen reader called Voice Over. Although it doesn't work flawlessly on Chrome, it works very well on Safari, so you should start checking the state of the a11y of your website/app using that and maybe consider checking Chrome with it as well.
