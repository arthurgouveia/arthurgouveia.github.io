  <p>I'm a Front End Developer @ <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, based in MontrÃ©al/QC - Canada.</p>

  <p>I'm a curious guy who found out that computers could do a lot of stuff, including building a lot of stuff, so I started to dig more and more into that. Aside from code I ðŸ’• design, but I ðŸ’© at it.</p>

  <p>Feed me pizza and/or ribs and you will be my very best friend.</p>
